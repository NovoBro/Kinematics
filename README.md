# Kinematics
An easy, command-line, projectile motion calculator

## About this program
This program runs on the command line. It will ask you to input values for a number of variables. It will then take that information and solve for as many other variables as possible by running it through basic kinematic equations. The program outputs a table of variables that compiles all the information it was given, and what it was able to figure out.

## Formule used:
- v = vi + a * t
- x = ((v + vi) / 2 ) * t
- x = vi * t + a * t * t / 2
- v * v = vi * vi + 2 * a * x
- ymax = (vi * sin(angle)) * (vi * sin(angle)) / 2 / ay
- t = 2 * vi * sin(angle) / ay
- xFinal = vi * vi * sin( 2 * angle ) / ay
- Other standard trigonomtric equations
